                            <p>In obeying his earthly father and his heavenly Father, Paul earned a Bachelor of Science in Ceramic Engineering at Missouri Science & Technology (formerly University of Missouri at Rolla) in 1972 and a Master of Divinity at Mid America Baptist Theological Seminary in 1993. He developed refractory products at Harbison Walker Refractories for 9 years and then worked for Exxon Research & Engineering and Valero Energy for 17 years. He served as a bi-vocational pastor in the inner city of Schenectady, NY. As a refractory engineer, he taught courses and provided refractory lining system designs in oil refining equipment in 21 countries. His greatest joy in life as husband, engineer and pastor has been to apply God’s wonderful truths from both creation and the Bible in every aspect of life. God is so good!</p>
